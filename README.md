# Virtual_Keyboard

I have created a **Virtual Keyboard** using deep learning with the help of *OpenCV* and *MediaPipe*.ðŸ’¡âœ¨
* Using OpenCV extract the visual features and processes real-time video and MediaPipe is used for gestures recognition, hand tracking and mapping hand movements to keystrokes âŒ¨
* This project allows users to type effortlessly on their devices without needing a physical keyboard. ðŸ’¯
